## Description
This repository provides a hands-on, step-by-step learning path for mastering Langchain AI. Each Python file in the project introduces a new concept, such as chains, agents, or memory, allowing beginners and intermediate learners to build AI-driven applications progressively. By following the files in order, you'll gain practical experience with Langchain's core features.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code (recommended)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SumonMohammad/ai-with-langchain.git 
 ```
  
2. **Create a Virtual Environment** :

 ```bash
    python -m venv langchain-env
 ```


3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   ## On Windows 
   - Navigate to the langchain-env\Scripts folder.
   - Copy the path to activate.ps1.
   - Open PowerShell, paste the path, and run: 

   
   .\langchain-env\Scripts\activate.ps1

   ## On Mac/Linux

   
   source langchain-env/bin/activate

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



## Usage 

Once the setup is complete, run the Python files in the root directory one by one. The files are organized sequentially (e.g., main.py, lcel.py, etc.) to guide you through the learning process.

```bash
python main.py
```


Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running any files. Follow the order of the files to understand the progression of Langchain concepts.
