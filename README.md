Description

This repository provides a progressive learning path for mastering LangChain AI.
Each Python file introduces a key concept — such as Chains, Agents, or Memory — helping you build practical, real-world AI applications powered by LLMs.

By following the files in sequence, you’ll gain both conceptual clarity and hands-on experience with LangChain’s core modules.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python ≥ 3.8

pip (Python package manager)

Git

VS Code (recommended editor)

Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/SumonMohammad/ai-with-langchain.git
cd ai-with-langchain

2. Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv langchain-env

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows (PowerShell)
.\langchain-env\Scripts\activate.ps1

On macOS/Linux
source langchain-env/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Once setup is complete, run the Python files sequentially — they are organized to teach LangChain concepts step by step.

Example:

python main.py


Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running any script.

Each file (e.g., main.py, lcel.py, etc.) builds upon the previous one to help you understand the progressive architecture of LangChain.
